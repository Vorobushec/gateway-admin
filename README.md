# gateway-admin
The gatewayAdmin app gives GL team administrators an easier way to manage files and repos on DCS.

## QA vs Production
To use QA add the "server=qa" parameter to the URL:
`https://gateway-edit.netlify.app/?server=qa`.  

This is a toggle and will stay pointed at QA until another setting is applied.

To point to production:
`https://gateway-edit.netlify.app/?server=prod`
